## Project Overview
E-commerce is one of the fastest-growing industries globally. By analyzing data from a virtual e-commerce platform, we can gain deeper insights into sales trends and the growth of this market. This analysis provides an objective view of various product aspects, identifying which categories are most attractive to online buyers. Additionally, it evaluates the effectiveness of promotions applied to each product and measures profitability, offering valuable insights to help the company make data-driven decisions for future sales seasons.
## Purpose
* How can you write a SQL query to calculate the total sales of furniture products,
grouped by each quarter of the year, and order the results chronologically?

* How can you analyze the impact of different discount levels on sales performance across product categories, 
specifically looking at the number of orders and total profit generated for each discount classification?
Discount level condition:
No Discount = 0
0 < Low Discount < 0.2
0.2 < Medium Discount < 0.5
High Discount > 0.5

* How can you create a report that displays each employee's performance across different product categories, 
showing not only the total profit per category but also what percentage of 
their total profit each category represents, with the results ordered by the 
percentage in descending order for each employee?

* How can you develop a user-defined function in SQL Server 
to calculate the profitability ratio for each product category an employee has sold, 
and then apply this function to generate a report that 
ranks each employee's product categories by their profitability ratio?
